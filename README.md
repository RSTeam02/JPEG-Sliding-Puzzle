# Rectangular Sliding-Puzzle (JPEG)

Extend previous project (Image-Slicer) into a Sliding Puzzle game

+ 26.04: tiles only moveable if shuffled
+ 26.04: return shuffled without split, join 
+ diagram added
+ 24.04: recalculate size of image raster dependent on browser window size
+ divide image into rows and columns (rectangular or square number of tiles)
+ shuffle tiles, reuse of shuffle.js from: https://github.com/RSTeam02/nxn_Sliding_Puzzle 
+ if all tiles are placed right, return "solved" (compare order of elements)
